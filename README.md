# Django-Files-Storage_retrievalSystem

Description: This Django app is a system that allows users to upload files, which are distributed across multiple nodes for redundancy and scalability. Users can retrieve files from the nearest or least-loaded node.

Key Features:
• File chunking and distributed storage across nodes (using a backend like MinIO or custom storage).
• Metadata storage in a centralized or semi-centralized Django-based service.
• APIs for file upload, retrieval, and management.
• Implementation of replication, deduplication, and error-checking mechanisms.
• Admin interface for node monitoring and file management.

Phase 1: Setup and Core Storage
• Initialize the Django project and set up storage with MinIO or a custom storage solution.
• Implement models to store file metadata (e.g., file size, location, owner).

Phase 2: File Chunking and Distribution
• Develop a file chunking mechanism for large files.
• Create APIs for file upload, chunk distribution, and retrieval.
• Integrate a distributed storage system or simulate nodes locally.

Phase 3: Redundancy and Error Handling
• Add file replication for redundancy.
• Implement error detection (e.g., checksums) and recovery mechanisms.

Phase 4: Retrieval Optimization
• Build logic to retrieve files from the nearest or least-loaded node.
• Add caching for frequently accessed files.

Phase 5: Monitoring and User Interface
• Design an admin panel to monitor file distribution and node statuses.
• Create a user-friendly interface for file uploads and downloads
